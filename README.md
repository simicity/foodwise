## About

### Description and Purpose

Foodwise helps people manage and monitor food items they have in thier refrigerator. This app allows users to keep track of what food items they have, their quantities, and expiration dates. Users can share the information among their housemates. This food tracking system facilitates to use their food resources efficiently, reduce food waste, and plan their meals based on the ingredients they have available. It's a handy tool for households, community organizations, and anyone interested in optimizing their food inventory.

### Inspiration

You're all set to cook that favorite recipe, only to find that a crucial ingredient you were sure you had, has magically disappeared - thanks to a helpful housemate! (Sometimes it's your yesterday self.) We've all been there, right? That relatable frustration sparked the idea for our app. We wanted to create a handy solution for managing your pantry and fridge to avoid those letdowns. Whether you're the master chef of the house or just someone tired of unwanted surprises, Foodwise is your answer to lessen "Who used the last egg?" moments and foster a more harmonious kitchen.
